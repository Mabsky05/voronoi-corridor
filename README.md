![main image](/References/image1.png)


## Summary
Generating and extruding a voronoi pattern on a given surface. 
Possible applications on corridor/hallway design. 
A goal is also to export components to excel/sheets for 3-D printing / manufacture

## Usage
Open .ghx file in Rhino 8, via Grasshopper in command line
View >> remote control panel to view inputs. 

## Description of Procedure
1) Generate voronoi pattern on pre-selected surface
3) Generate pattern thickness and depth
4) Split pattern into multiple components
5) Export components into excel.
